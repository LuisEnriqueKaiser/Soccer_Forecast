    away_stat_col,
    stat_name,
    home_team_col="home_team",

):
    """
    For each row in df, calculate:
      - The mean of 'home_stat_col' / 'away_stat_col' for the home team over its last n matches (regardless of venue).
      - The mean of 'home_stat_col' / 'away_stat_col' for the away team over its last n matches (regardless of venue).

    This mirrors the style of your reference code, but now uses 'home_team' / 'away_team'
    columns and separate home_stat_col / away_stat_col.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with at least:
          - 'home_team', 'away_team' (or custom, if you pass them in)
          - The two stat columns, e.g. 'Home_Expected_xG' and 'Away_Expected_xG'
    n : int
        Number of past matches to consider
    home_stat_col : str
        Column name containing the "home" version of the stat (e.g. 'Home_Expected_xG')
    away_stat_col : str
        Column name containing the "away" version of the stat (e.g. 'Away_Expected_xG')
    stat_name : str
        Will be used in naming the new output columns:
        'home_mean_{stat_name}_last_{n}' and 'away_mean_{stat_name}_last_{n}'
    home_team_col : str, default "home_team"
        Name of the column that tells us which team is at home
    away_team_col : str, default "away_team"
        Name of the column that tells us which team is away

    Returns
