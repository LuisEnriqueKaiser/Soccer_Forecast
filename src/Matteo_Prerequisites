I suspect that you do not want to run the whole code again, especially because large chunks are not directly related to the "bayesian" part of this paper. 

For the bayesian parts, I also supply the relevant prepared datasets so that you can run only these parts locally. 
The following things should be changed accordingly to your machine. It is basically just changing the paths at the right place. 

The baseline bayesian model: 
07_01_model_bayes.R: 
1) data_raw <- read.csv(
  "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/data/final/train_data.csv", 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
) --> Change to the right path
2) output_dir <- "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/results/Bayes_base_results"
--> Change to the right path (on multiple occasions in the code)
3) test_file <- "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/data/final/test_data.csv"
--> Change to the right path
4) write.csv(results, "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/data/final/results_bayes_base.csv", row.names = FALSE)
--> Change to the right path in the end


The advanced bayesian model: 
07_02_season_based_prior_model.R: 
1) data_raw <- read.csv(
  "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/data/final/train_data.csv", 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
) --> Change to the right path
2) test_file <- "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/data/final/test_data.csv"
--> Change to the right path
3) output_dir <- "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/results/bayes_season_prior"
--> Change to the right path (on multiple occasions in the code)

4) out_csv <- "/Users/luisenriquekaiser/Documents/soccer_betting_forecast/data/final/results_bayes_season.csv"
--> Change to the right path in the end


For the betting strategy code, you need to first run the other files. After that the paths also have to be changed accordingly.
